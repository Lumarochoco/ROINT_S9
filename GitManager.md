# Projet ROINT Git Manager

## Install Git

To check if you have git, check the version with the following command :  
 > git --version

 If no message is written, then you need to install git.  
Go to this website :  

> https://git-scm.com/

 You can check if git is well installed by checking the version like we did in a first time.

## Get the project from Github / Clone the project

Here, we use the HTTPS link.  
Find here the link of the project :  

> https://github.com/Lumarochoco/ROINT_S9.git

 Next, thanks to your terminal, go where you want to put the folder.    

 > cd C:\chemin\vers\ton\répertoire

You can also create the directory with the following command : 

> mkdir C:\chemin\vers\ton\répertoire

Then, use the following command for cloning the repository in your machine :

> git clone https://github.com/Lumarochoco/ROINT_S9.git

 ## Put your updates on GitHub 

**Go to the directory of the project first**

 ### Token

 If you have already created a token, you can directly go to the next step.  
 Hence, go to this website for creating a new github token (classic) :  

 > https://github.com/settings/tokens

### Configur Git

If you’ve never configured Git on your machine, start by setting your name and email (which will be attached to your commits). Use these commands in the terminal :

> git config --global user.name "Your Name"

> git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"

### Check for changes

Go to the directory of the project.  
Before pushing your changes, check which files have been modified using : 

> git status

You can also use this command to see the progression in the *pushing process*.  

### Add changes to the staging area  

You need to add the modified or created files to the staging area before commiting :

* To add all changed files : 
> - git add .

* To add specific files :
> - git add *path/namefile*

### Commit the changes

Once files are added to the staging area, create a commit to save the changes with a descriptive message:  

> git commit -m "Description of your changes"

### Push the changes to GitHub

Finally, push the changes to the remote repository on GitHub using :

> git push origin master

*In our case, **master** refers to the main branch of the repository. If you are working in another branc, replace **master** with 
the appropriate branch name.*

## Import the lastest version / Pull the repository

### Navigate to the local repository

Fist, navigate to the local repository.  

### Pull the changes

Use the following command to pull the latest changes from the remote repository to your local repository :

> git pull origin master

*In our case, **master** is the default name for the remote repository.*

### Resolve conflits (if any)

If there are changes both in your local repository and on GitHub, there might be merge conflicts. Git will notify you if there are any, and you will need to manually resolve them before completing the pull.  

Once you’ve resolved any conflicts, stage the changes, commit them, and finish the pull.
